This DNS injection script enables a man-on-the-side (MOTS) attack by intercepting DNS queries and injecting forged responses that redirect the queried domain to an attacker-controlled IP. 
The script listens for DNS requests using Scapy, creates a fake DNS response with a matching transaction ID and other necessary fields, and sends it back to the client. 
By responding faster than the legitimate DNS server, the forged response reaches the client first, effectively rerouting the traffic without directly disrupting the original DNS communication. 
This approach exploits DNS’s lack of authentication and UDP’s non-reliable transmission, allowing the attacker to influence traffic direction discreetly.
